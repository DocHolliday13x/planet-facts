### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS and how to manipulate SVGs. This was an excellent project for HTML practice, and even though I am proud of what I have done, I know that it can be significantly improved. I am excited to continue working on this project and make it even better.

### Continued development

I have reached minimum viable product, but this is not quite where I want it to be. I will continue to work on this project until I am satisfied with the result.

There is still some small issues that I need to figure out, such as finding a better font, and making the site more responsive. I also need to add a favicon and a title to the site. One other small detail is that the SVG for Saturn is not displaying correctly. I will need to revisit this and correct it.
